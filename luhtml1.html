	<p>Here is first paragraph You already have an HTML-document. In < body > add two paragraphs ( < p >) with any text you like. Please, separate these two tags with a horizontal rule  
    (< hr > tag). </p>
	<hr>
	<p>Here goes the second.  Probably, you still have a question: "What does the < meta charset="utf-8" >  tag do?" Well, this is a special tag â€” a meta-tag. Meta-tags are used for describing a document. It's a bit weird, but keep thinking about meta-tags as an information aboutnformation. Directly, this tag means that we want to use the utf-8 charset for our document.</p>
